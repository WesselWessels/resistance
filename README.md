mental maze

mentalmaze is a browser puzzle game where you must try and solve a maze in your head. 

You can play it here:

To visualise it, imagine you are starting in the bottom right corner of the maze and you face upward. 

Your goal is to reach the top left corner of the maze to escape it.

The only information you have is the number of blocks open next to you.

If the numbers are

[ ][3][ ]<br>
[1][ ][0]<br>
[ ][0][ ]<br>

it means there are 3 blocks open in front of you and 1 block open on the left. 
Behind you and to your right is a wall.

If you turn left, you would rotate to the left and would get:

[ ][1][ ]<br>
[0][ ][3]<br>
[ ][0][ ]<br>

By pressing the forward key or Move button, you would move one block forward and get new information about the block you are in.
