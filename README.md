Good vs Bad

This is a basic implementation of the boardgame The Resistance. Consider buying it.

This is not intended to replace The Resistance boardgame, but rather to offer a means of playing it for people who don't have the boardgame with them (like at a restaurant).

The project is not affiliated with The Resistance in any way. I am still looking for a good idea for names of roles.
